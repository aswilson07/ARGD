This repository contains the code for the plots contained in the paper accelerating rescaled gradient descent (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08825.pdf)
The code is written in Jupyter notebooks with python2 and requires installing a numerical integration library called “nodepy”. 
The code is directly adapted from code used in the paper http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7646-direct-runge-kutta-discretization-achieves-acceleration.pdf 
provided by the author Jingzhao Zhang.
The code is maintained by Ashia C. Wilson. Please email aswilson07@gmail.com for any comments or concerns.
